GolfPro is a website which main purpose is to feed your typical golf specialist with a bunch of information that the user can query the way they want. The team took on the challenge to create a website that rests on a couple of linked tables’ altogether. Sport spreadsheets can be found across the web. They are organized by events, take the form of a ranking system (from 1 to X) and display numerous stats related to the sport in question. If all the events described above were to be found in a single web-page, then this would ease the end-user’s quality of life when it comes to gaining information about their favourite sport. 
	The team started looking for interesting tables to put together. Golf has numerous splendid websites out there, related to a specific event or a time of the year. The goal was now to look through each to get the most relevant data. Once this has been setup, the first task was to display those tables, in a rough draft, in our website to get a feel out of it. Rails “magic” operates and tables are displayed; the team now has to focus on the design. We wanted to focus on a simple, non-eye-catching background, as we believe the site to make more sense with a humble design. Bootstrap was a challenge to get our head into but turned out pretty successfully. The mobile design came at a later stage, alongside the different deployment to Heroku that were done as regularly as possible, as it was recommended in the Hartl book.
	After those processes came development specificity issued from the assessment. Implementing google maps API created the need for a new set of table, a tournament section, where one can observe the different upcoming tournament and locate them in a map. This gave our application extra dimension. Graphs have been implemented when seeking more information about a specific table. If a player appears in our different tables, a graph of the average of his points given a year would be displayed. This curve is the reason why certain users would prefer our website compared to others, as their tables are linked with a different logic than ours.

	What spiked our interest were the number of gems available to the ruby language. It was a pleasure to realise that when googling an error, people has had the same as us. Multiple time did we come across a gem that should solve our given problem, sometime did and most of the time didn’t. They appear as highly flexible tool a web-application developer would enjoy.

	The teamwork itself has proven to be of extreme educative value. While understanding is the first step, application is where knowledge shines. The team effort forced both of us to explain to each other what was going on in the code, which lead to a more profound understanding of Ruby on Rails. Git was difficult to adhere too; although after couple of sessions using it proved to be the best friend a programmer can have.

	This team project was a real challenge. Designing stages are the most optimistic, although the development process left us scared. It was an intellectual challenge that could be very frustrating, or at least ruby is. By going through this hardship, we believe our competences as web-application developer have been drastically increased and found this project interesting.
